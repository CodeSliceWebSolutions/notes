<p>Parents sacrifice and suffer because they have a certain hope for their children e.g. go to school, get a job. If child feels pitty for parents and tries helping them without doing what parents hope for is that going to make parents happy?</p>

<p>No, same with Jesus. His sacrifice was to make us priests. Even if we pitty and help Jesus if we do not become priests that promise/hope is not accomplished</p>
